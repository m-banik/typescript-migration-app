# TypeScript Migration App

Simple application made in purpose to demonstrate how an easy React app may be migrated to the TypeScript syntax.

## Scripts
To run the app in the development mode use the `npm run dev` command. To see the other available scripts check the `package.json` file.

## Switching between the languages
The project has just two git branches. `main` contains the JavaScript version of the code while the branch entitled `ts` contains the TypeScript version of it. Use the basic `git checkout` command to navigate.
